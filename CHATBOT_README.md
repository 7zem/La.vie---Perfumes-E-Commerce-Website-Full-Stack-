- **Chat DTOs**: Data transfer objects for chat messages and responses

### 2. Frontend Integration

#### Option A: Floating Widget (Recommended)

Add this to any webpage where you want the chatbot:

```html
<!-- Add the chatbot widget script -->
<script src="/chatbot-widget.js"></script>

<!-- Initialize the chatbot -->
<script>
    new PerfumeChatbotWidget({
        apiUrl: 'http://localhost:5080/api/chatbot',
        position: 'bottom-right', // or 'bottom-left'
        title: 'Perfume Assistant',
        subtitle: 'Ask me anything!'
    });
</script>
```

#### Option B: Full-Page Chat Interface

For a dedicated chat page, use the full interface:

```html
<!-- Include the full chatbot interface -->
<iframe src="/chatbot.html" width="100%" height="600px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
```

### 3. Configuration Options

```javascript
new PerfumeChatbotWidget({
    // API endpoint
    apiUrl: 'http://localhost:5080/api/chatbot',
    
    // Widget position
    position: 'bottom-right', // 'bottom-right', 'bottom-left'
    
    // Customization
    title: 'Perfume Assistant',

## üß† How It Works

### Intent Recognition
The chatbot automatically categorizes customer messages into different intents:

- **ShippingInfo**: "Shipping costs", "Delivery time"
- **ReturnPolicy**: "Can I return this?", "Return policy"
- **AccountHelp**: "Forgot password", "Create account"
- **TechnicalSupport**: "Website not working", "Error message"

### Response Generation
1. **Intent Analysis**: Determines what the customer is asking about
2. **Context Processing**: Considers current page, previous messages, user preferences
3. **Knowledge Base Lookup**: Searches product catalog, FAQ, and policies
4. **Response Generation**: Creates personalized, helpful responses
5. **Product Matching**: Finds relevant products to recommend
6. **Suggestion Creation**: Generates helpful follow-up suggestions

### Product Recommendations
The chatbot can recommend products based on:
- **Direct mentions**: "Show me Chanel N¬∞5"
- **Category preferences**: "Men's fragrances", "Women's perfumes"
- **Brand preferences**: "Dior perfumes", "Tom Ford fragrances"
- **Price range**: "Under $100", "Expensive perfumes"
- **Occasion**: "Gift for girlfriend", "Work fragrance"

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Responses
Edit the `_faqResponses` dictionary in `ChatbotService.cs`:

```csharp
private readonly Dictionary<string, string> _faqResponses = new()
{
    { "shipping", "We offer free shipping on orders over $50..." },
    { "return", "We have a 30-day return policy..." },
    { "new-topic", "Your custom response here..." }
};
```

```csharp
private readonly Dictionary<string, string[]> _intentKeywords = new()
{
    { "NewIntent", new[] { "keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3" } }
};
```
